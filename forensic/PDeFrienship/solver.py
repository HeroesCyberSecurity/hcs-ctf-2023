text = '''
in the taestry of life, a thread so true,
friendshiP's bond emerges in vibrant hue.
two souls entwined, a journey to embark,
a symphony of trust, lighting up the Dark.

through valleys low and mountains high,
Friendship's wings help us touch the sky.
a shelter In storms, a beacon in the night,
guiding us forward with itS gentle light.

like a spring's first bloom, Friendships start,
nurtured by kindness from the heart.
in laughter shared and tears that fall,
we find solace in each otheR's call.

different as rivers that wind and twist,
yet merging in harmony, never to resist.
united in purpose, hand In hand,
friendship's dancE across the land.

in the garden of life, friendship's a flower,
blooming with grace, its fragrance a shower.
watered by moments, both big aNd small,
it stands strong anD tall, never to fall.

with empathy as its rootS and joy as its leaves,
friendship's magic sOothes and relieves.
in the gallery of memories, portraits bright,
Friendship paints colors oF sheer delight.

distance may stretch its threads thin,
but in the heart's canvas, it's woven in.
time may age the stories we've spun,
but friendship's melody cAn never be undone.

so Let's raise a toast to bonds that bind,
a treasure of the heart, one of a kind.
through life's ebb and flow, hand in hand,
friendship's symphony pLays, forever grand..
